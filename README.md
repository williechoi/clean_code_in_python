## Clean Code in Python

Oftentimes, I am too busy to care about how to create neat and organized code base, 
because meeting deadlines and living up to others' demands take precedence over writing clean codes.
However, disorganized and ill-documented codes often caught up with me in the later phase of development,
when I need to fix some bugs or add more features to the existing project.  

This repository intends to overcome such bad practices by practicing how to write codes that are easily understood and fixed.
